**Setting Up Your Project**

Before proceeding, ensure that both the project name and the database name are set to **eDiary**. Using any other name may result in issues when working on your localhost environment.

**1. Change the Project Folder Name:**
   - Open the `js` folder.
   - Inside the `custom.js` file, locate the third line with the following code: `var url=window.location.origin+'/eDiary';`.
   - Replace the word `eDiary` with the name of your project folder.

**2. Update the Files Folder:**
   - Navigate to the `files` folder.
   - In the `function.php` file, look for the line with `define("BASEURL","http://localhost/ediary");`.
   - Replace the word `ediary` with the name of your project folder.

**3. Modify the Database Name:**
   - In the `function.php` file, locate the function named `connection`.
   - Inside this function, find the `dbname` value and update it with the desired database name.
   - Be sure to update the name type accordingly.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your project folder, file references, and database connections are appropriately configured for your development environment.
